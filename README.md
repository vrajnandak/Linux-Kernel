# Linux-Kernel
This repository contains all of the activities, related to the linux kernel, that i've done in the summer 2024 under the guidance of Professor R.Badrinath.
References have been mentioned in the documents.
The MY_KERNEL_DOCUMENTATION contains the steps to re-create the things I've done along with the source code.
The MY_KERNEL_DOCUMENTATION_ROUGH contains all of the things that I've noticed while trying to navigate through the source code and create some functionalities to better understand the kernel.


# Some additional Utilities to use
## 'cscope': A programming tool to able to navigate through the source code efficiently
## 'find . -name file_name': This is a terminal command to recursively search for the given file name in the current directory and all of it's sub-directories.
## 'grep -r pattern .': This is another terminal command to recursively search for a given pattern in all the files in the current directory as well as it's sub-directories.
